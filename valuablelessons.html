                <p>
                    With every job, I believe that a person learns something new. Every job takes place in a
                    different environment and with every change in environment there is something new to be
                    learned no matter how small. I will be sharing some of the things I've learned from my 
                    modest experience.

                    <dd>
                        Working at Toro Glasswall taught me that I am a fast learner. I worked on a piece of machinery that I had
                        never seen before and I managed to be as effective of a worker as my coworker who had 3 more years of
                        experience.

                    <dt>Teamwork and Communication</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Working at Harveys taught me that in an undertsaffed working environment, it is very important to know 
                        how to coordinate with your coworkers. Working in an environment that had more duties to be done than
                        there were people to complete them taught me a lot about proper teamwork and communication skills. This way, we 
                        could get everything done in a timely manner.

                    <dt>Hard-Working</dt>
                    <dd>
                        From all of my jobs, I learned that I am a hard worker. It didn't matter to me if I knew that my coworkers were 
                        slacking or not getting all of their jobs done, I never did the same. I always did what was asked of me in the 
                        time that I was asked to do it.
