                        Hobbies contribute a very important part to someone's personality, they make it easier for
                        an individual to seek out like minded people when engaging in conversation. If the individuals 
                        hobbies are tedious and require a lot of patience, these hobbies will make the person more patient
                        when dealing with frustrating situations in life. I believe it would be ideal if people had 
                        hobbies that developed skills rather than hobbies that are meant to kill time.

                            I greatly enjoy learning about the engineering that goes into making cars work and taking photos
                            of cars that catch my eye. I also enjoy doing maintenance on my car by myself as opposed to going 
                            to a mechanic. Not only do I earn valuable experience but I also get to save some money. To the

                            I am very fond of electric guitar, bass guitar and music in general. It is for this reason that I am
                            in a small music project with my friend from Ryerson University. Though it can be technically 
                            challenging at times, the time and effort pays off when the final product comes together. To the left
                            is a song I recorded with a friend.

                            With the rise of ultra connectivity via the internet and people seemingly becoming busier and busier
                            by the year, reading has understandably become less popular. It is a time consuming activity 
                            especially if you're a slow reader but giving yourself a few moments of silence and leaving yourself 
                            to your thoughts after a long week is a nice way to unwind. To the left is a photo of some books i've read.
