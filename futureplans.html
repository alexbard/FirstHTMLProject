                <h2>Further Post-Secondary</h2>

                <p>
                    After I finish my education at Humber College I plan to get further education at a university
                    as I believe this will make it easier for me to obtain my first job in programming.
                </p>

                <h2>Career</h2>

                <p>
                    After I finish my post-secondary education, I plan to seek out a career at 
                    Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services is the biggest provider for cloud storage and as a result 
                    obtaining experience here would be invaluable for future careers if I wish to change employers.
                </p>

                <h2>Privately Owned Business</h2>
                
                <p>
                    I have always felt that working for a company for my entire life then retiring isn't a
                    satisfactory way to live. Because of this, I have always had a dream of eventually starting a
                    private business or being self-employed. This means I can either be a freelance programmer or
                    I can improve upon a product that already exists or create a new product. Unfortunately though, 
                    I simply haven't come up with an idea yet.
