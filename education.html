                <h2>Education</h2>

                <p>
                    Education is one of the defining features of an individual, whether one chooses to pursue
                    higher education or not will greatly change a persons life and will yield completely 
                    different personalities. An education can help a young person develop a healthy work ethic
                    as well as provides them with a degree that allows them to get a decent career.

                    <dt>John English Middle School</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The first school I attended was John English. Here, I made my first
                        friends, some of which have stayed with me to this day. I also studied
                        French in this school from the age of four. I am grateful that this school 
                        was in a good neighbourhood as children are very easily influenced at a 
                        young age and being raised in a bad neighbourhood could've drastically 
                        changed where I would've been today.

                    <dd>
                        Richview is where I went to high school. I furthered my studying of French
                        here for four more years in a French program. Most notably, I managed to achieve 
                        honour roll in this school for all four years and graduated with a certificate of 
                        proficiency in French.

                    <dt>Linux Course</dt>
                    <dd>
                        During my break from school, I finished a course in Linux which was my first taste of
                        the programming world. I ended up liking it and decided to go to school to become a 
                        programmer instead of going to schoolx   to be a pilot.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Humber College</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Here is where I am currently going to school to become a programming professional. Ideally, 
                        I will be able to get into a co-op program and career to make a living off of the degree that 
                        I earn here.
