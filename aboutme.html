                <h2>About My Family and I</h2>

                <p>
                    My immediate family consists of my father, my mother, my brother and my sister. I'll mainly
                    be telling you about my parents because I've probably told you enough about myself already 
                    and my siblings share the same story as me having been born in Canada.
                </p>

                    <h3>My Father</h3>
                    <p>
                        My father was born in the USSR in Minsk, Belarus on June 2 in 1957. His father was in the army 
                        so his family moved around a lot as he would have to serve in different countries. My father lived in
                        Kazakhstan for most of his youth.

                    <h3>My Mother</h3>
                    <p>
                        My mother was born in the USSR in Kiev, Ukraine on February 13 in 1962. She had a very large family 
                        of five siblings and she lived there her whole life. My parents met in Kiev in 1990 when my father went there to find work after finishing 
                        his mandatory service in the military. In 1999, my parents finished their immigration process and arrived
                        in Canada.

                        Never let injustice go unchecked if you have the power to do something about it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You won't get anywhere in life if you're not willing to work hard
                    </li>
                    <li>
