                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    In today's world, work experience is indispensable. Without it, it is unlikely that you 
                    will find a job worth keeping in the long term. This is why it is important that young adults 
                    gather some experience in any job that they can find, most of which will be minimum wage. These
                    first jobs will develop your skills to some extent and give you some idea of the jobs you'd like 
                    and wouldn't like to have.

                    <h3>Harveys</h3>
                    <p>
                        My first job was at Harveys where I mainly worked as a cashier. This particular establishment was severely
                        understaffed so I ended up working as a cashier, janitor and a garnisher depending on what needed to be done
                        at the time. Also, earning experience as a cashier made me realize that if I'm seeking out a temporary job
                        I know for certain that I do not want to be a cashier.

                    <h3>Toro Glasswall Inc</h3>
                    <p>
                        My second job was at Toro Glasswall Inc. It is by far the most valuable work experience that I have earned. 
                        Not only was it my first full time job but my role was also relatively complex when compared to the common
                        jobs that people my age have. I had to operate a CNC machine which milled aluminum blocks into frames for 
                        high-rise buildings. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sobeys</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the job that I currently have. I work as a maintenance employee who takes care of the cleanliness of
                        the store. The reason I got this job is simply because I needed to earn money on the weekends considering
                        I have school on weekdays. Being a relatively simple job, it fits perfectly with my goals as I wanted this job
                        because it is simple.
